# menu-color-slider
Hover over a menu item and three things happen:
(1) An underline swings underneath that menu item
(2) The underline changes color
(3) The underline changes length to match the menu width

You can customize a few things here:
(1) The color of each menu item
(2) The delay for the underline to move
(3) The "friction" of the underline movement

One major issue: The width of the starting position needs to be set manually. Didn't have time to fix this, would appreciate help :).
